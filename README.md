The Game of Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician ***John Horton Conway*** in 1970.                                             
It is a **zero-player** game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.                 

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional
orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states,
* Live (or populated)
* Dead (or unpopulated)

Every cell interacts with its 8 neighbours, which are the cells that are *horizontally*, *vertically*, or *diagonally* adjacent. 

*At each step in time, the following transitions occur:*

* Any live cell with **fewer than two live neighbours dies** , as if by *underpopulation*.

* Any live cell with **two or three live neighbours lives** on to the next generation.

* Any live cell with **more than three live neighbours dies**, as if by overpopulation.

* Any dead cell with **exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell**, as if by reproduction.


## How to play

**There are 2 modes in the game**
* [***Edit Mode***](#edit-mode)
* [***Play Mode***](#play-mode)

### Edit Mode <a name="edit-mode"/>
**In edit mode you can**
* Add new cell with **`Mouse Left Click`**
* Remove a cell with **`Mouse Right Click`**
* Hide the grid *(in edit mode only)* with **`ALT + V`**
* Show the grid *(in edit mode only)* with **`ALT + V`**
* Start the Game with **`Mouse Middle Click`**

### Play Mode <a name="play-mode"/>
**In edit mode you can**
